Introduction
============

Tipsi integration API implemented as REST and provides ability to interact with your retail data
programmatically. Supported operations described below:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   quick_start
   store_operations
   list_or_create_operations
   ext_ids_operations
   full_text_search
   pos_sync
   label_processing_tasks.rst
   api_examples.rst


Our production integration server domain is **integration.gettipsi.com**, we also provide a separate
sandbox for experiments - **integration-test.gettipsi.com**, on that domain you can play with API
without worries to accidentally break anything.

Now it's time to check :ref:`quick_start`.
